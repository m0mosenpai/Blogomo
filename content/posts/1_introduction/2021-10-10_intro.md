Hey! I'm starting this blog to share whatever I learn, maybe teach a few things myself and just talk about life. As of now, I'm a 21 (almost 22) year old 4th year Electronics student from India. I like to code (mostly in Python), play games and do other nerd stuff.

Sounds interesting? Lookout for a new post (hopefully) every week.
