The MLH Fellowship is kind of 3 month long internship alternative, that pairs students from all over the world with Open Source mentors and other experienced software developers. It first caught my eye when some of my friends told me about a new open source program that was not only sponsored by GitHub and Facebook, but also had an interesting curriculum and paid well.
