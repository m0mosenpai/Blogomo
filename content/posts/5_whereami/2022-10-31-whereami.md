It's been a long time since I posted anything here. Haven't been upto a lot outside my work when it comes to tech/ programming and it's that existential time of the year when you feel like you've got to do something with your life.  

A few notable things that happened in the past one year:

**>>**  _**Successfully got a full-time job as a Software Engineer**_  
&emsp;With my never-ending struggles with DSA, feels pretty lucky to be where I am right now.  

**>>**  _**Travelled to Singapore - my first ever flight and international family trip!**_  
&emsp;Highly encourage everyone to travel abroad atleast once. It can be quite inspiring!

**>>**  _**Managed to consistently work out for the past 5 months and counting**_  
&emsp;Understanding my own body and working towards a fitness goal really gave me a sense &emsp;of direction at a time I felt kind of stuck. A huge confidence booster too!

**>>**  _**Reached Grand Champion in Rocket League after 4 years (2500+ hrs)**_   
&emsp;A goal of mine since I started playing this game back in 2018.  
&emsp;Taught me patience, consistency and the ability to believe in myself.

**>>**  _**Finished Elden Ring along with rest of the SoulsBorneKiro games.**_  
&emsp;Absolutely incredible games all of them.  

**>>**  _**Went out of my way to surprise my best friend on her 21st Birthday.**_  
&emsp;Really felt like I should show my appreciation to the people I care about more actively.  
&emsp;This was one of the examples for it. Also made more efforts in meeting/ interacting with &emsp;new people and strengthening the bonds with older ones.


Some of these things might feel pretty trivial (and they probably are :P) but they have no doubt, helped me keep an optimistic view of life and keep going :)

Will be back with more technical posts soon!
